Can Wastewater Nutrient Discharge be optimized using machine learning?
Perform a feasibility study that relies on a classification tree to predict whether an industrial wastewater plant would be able to meet new total nitrogen limits of 10 mg/L.
Leveraging on constrained ordination methods, identify "constraining variables" that may be prominent drivers for effluent ammonia and nitrate concentration behaviors.
